Here is the main analysis code of this study. First, the scRNA-seq data from the renal cortex of DKD patients were re-analyzed (GSE195460_reanalysis.R). Next, the glomerular cell populations were extracted, and DKD-related cell populations were identified using LP_SGL (glomerulus.R). Finally, differential analysis and the construction of a disease prediction model identified NRG1 as a biomarker for DKD (Lasso.R).
